            MAP - FILTER - REDUCE

1) what is Map()??

map() is an array method that return the new array by calling the function to each array element;

==> it return us new array with the result

==> it doesn't modified the original array

==> it loop over every array element


2) what is Filter()??

filter() array method apply the conditions to an array and if the condition is passed (true) it return that passed array element

==> does not execute for empty array

==> it does not change the original array


3) what is Reduce()?
The reduce method in JavaScript iterates over an array, applying a function to accumulate its elements into a single value.
It takes two arguments: a callback function (with an accumulator and the current item) and an optional initial value for the accumulator.

==> in this initial state it have no value for acc (accumulator) so we have to provide the initial value = 0;

==> doesn't modified the original array

==> return new single value
