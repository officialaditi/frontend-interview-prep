  lexical scoping:-

  lexical scoping means the function can access the variable that been declared within that scope or their parent scope (outer) or to global scope also.

let globalVar = "im global variable";

function show() {
  let funcVar = "im show function variable";
  function display() {
    console.log(funcVar);
  }
  display();
}
show();

here we have define 2 variable 1) globalVar 2) funcVar
---> globalVar can be used my anyone as its defined in global scope

---> funcVar can be only used within the local or function scope only not outside the function scope
