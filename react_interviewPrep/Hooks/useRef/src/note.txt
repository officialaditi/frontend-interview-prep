useRef hook

definition:-  useRef hook is used to for persist the values between render, It can be used to store a mutable value that does not cause a re-render when updated.

simple:- it updates the value but its doesn't cause re-render of the component while updating
example :-
if we use [useState] is update the value and re-render the component, whereas in [useRef] is update the value but doesn't re-render the component 

useRef return only one item = current, it only return [current]

when we initial useRef() we set the inital value example := useRef(0);

to access the initial value or any value in the ref we have to use      [.current] property example:- count.current = which is 0 as initial

syntax:-
const anyNameRef = useRef(0);
acceess = anyNameRef.current
