what is useEffect hook:-

=> this hook is used for handling the side effects, such as fetching data from api, updating dom directly, using setTimeout or setInterval.

=> it render when the component get mount on the screen for 1st time 

=> this hook take 2 thing <function()> and [dependency array];

=> 1)if we have not provide any dependency useEffect will render everytime 
2) if we have empty dependency array it will render only once the page get load
3) if we have value inside the dependency array it will render 1 time and whenever the value inside the dependency array get change it will re-render

syntax:-

useEffect(() => {
    // side effect code

    return (
        //clean up function (optional)
    )
},[dependency array])


cleanup function:- for 1st time when component get mounted, and after :-
the function only run when the component get unmounted or if the dependency array we put inside got updated
