Ques 4: What is the difference between state and props?
===> state :- 1) state is an object that hold dynamic data for a component;
              2) it allow a component to store information that change over the time like user input, ui, api response;
              3) when state changes React automatically re-render to reflect the new data;
              4) think 'state' as memory of component for tracking information that might change.

===> props:- 1) props means properties
             2) props are used to pass data from one component to another;
             3) we can send the data from parent component to child component via props;
